## Overview

![screenshot](src/assets/images/appG.gif)

This app was built with the purpose to better my programming skills, and this is a challenge from [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/).

My experience to develop this project was great, I learned how to use Weather API by [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and how to use Mapbox Geocoding API by [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/) I learned a lot of working with these APIs.
